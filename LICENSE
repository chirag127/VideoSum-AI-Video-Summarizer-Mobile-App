By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions

a.  Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with an image or a video.
b.  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright, including, but not limited to, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.
c.  Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
d.  Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
e.  Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
f.  Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
g.  Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.
h.  NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
i.  Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that enable members of the public to access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.
j.  Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
k.  You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope

a.  License grant.
    1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        A.  reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only;
        B.  produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
    2.  Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
    3.  Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
    4.  Media and formats; technical modifications. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.
    5.  Downstream recipients.
        A.  Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        B.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
b.  Other rights. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not transfer or relinquish any of the Licensor’s Copyright and Similar Rights; nor does it transfer or relinquish any moral rights, including the right to integrity; nor does it grant You the right to use the Licensor’s or any other person’s publicity, privacy, or personality rights, or any similar rights.

Section 3 – License Conditions

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

a.  Attribution.
    1.  If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
        A.  retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, a copyright notice, a license notice, a disclaimer notice, and a link to the Licensed Material; and
        B.  indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of previous modifications; and
        C.  indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI for, this Public License.
    2.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or link to a resource that includes the required information.
    3.  If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
b.  NonCommercial. You may not exercise the Licensed Rights for commercial purposes.

Section 4 – Representations, Warranties, and Disclaimer

a.  Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.
b.  Limitation of liability. To the extent possible, the Licensor will not be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for direct, incidental, or consequential damages, so this exclusion or limitation may not apply to You.

Section 5 – Term and Termination

a.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.
b.  Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 5(a), it reinstates:
    1.  automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
    2.  upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.
c.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. 
d.  Sections 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 6 – Other Terms and Conditions

a.  The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed in writing.
b.  Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from, and independent of, the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 7 – Interpretation

a.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that cannot lawfully be subject to Copyright and Similar Rights under applicable law. 
b.  To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remainder of this Public License.
c.  No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor in writing.
d.  Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as a limitation upon rights the Licensor may have pursuant to any applicable law or other contractual arrangement.
